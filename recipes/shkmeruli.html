    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shkmeruli is a chicken dish from the village of Shkmeri, Racha region of Georgia. Chicken in a special spicy sauce with garlic and milk, often cooked on a clay pan.</p>
    <p>Traditionally shkmeruli is cooked and served in a ketsi, an earthenware casserole dish, with roasted chicken suffused in an ablution of garlic and dairy in the form of butter or milk. In Bourdain’s case, the waiter served pieces of grilled chicken on our plates then poured the milky sauce afterwards, which was great for the cameras, but shkmeruli scorns sophistication. We wanted Tony to revel in the joy of forking out a chunk of dripping chicken from a sizzling ketsi and spooning as much of the pungent virtue as he pleased. And then, over absorbing conversation, we would wipe the ketsi clean with chunks of tonis puri.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1kg (2.2lb) whole chicken, butterflied</li>
        <li>10-12 cloves of garlic, finely minced or grated</li>
        <li>350ml (1 1/3 cup) whole milk</li>
        <li>50g (4 tablespoons) butter, divided</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Pat your chicken dry with paper towels and season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat in a large, oven-safe skillet until shimmering. Place the chicken breast-side down in the pan and sear chicken without touching until skin is deep brown and crispy, about 8-10 minutes. Flip chicken using tongs and cook the other side for about 5-10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from pan, transfer to a plate, uncovered to ensure skin remains crispy. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, reduce heat to medium-low and 20 grams of butter. Melt until foamy and add the garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Switching to a whisk, slowly drizzle in milk while whisking constantly. Once all of the milk is added continue whisking until it reaches a simmer.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet and move to the oven and finish cooking until done, or when an instant-read thermometer reads 74°C (165°F) when inserted into the thickest part of the breast, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and take the chicken out the pan and allow to rest while finishing sauce. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and, whisking constantly, add butter one pat at a time, whisking until one pat is completely incorporated until adding another. Sauce should be glossy and homogenous. Simmer for about 5 minutes further until slightly thickened and reduced.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, transfer chicken to a cutting board and using a sharp knife, divide into 4-6 pieces. Transfer back into the skillet or into a serving dish and pour sauce over chicken,</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, preferably with a side of crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
